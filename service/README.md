# Introduction

The `service` component implements an NLP application runner for text-processing and exposes a REST endpoint for communication.

For the moment, only a runner for [GATE NLP](https://gate.ac.uk/) (using GATE Embedded) applications has been implemented.


# Configuration

The application requires a configuration file, which specifies which NLP application should be run with additional parameters. An example configuration file is provided in `src/main/resources/application.properties`


# API specification

- TODO


# Missing
- tests
